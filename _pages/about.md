I am a Research Scholar at Stanford University’s [Center for International Security and Cooperation (CISAC)](https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/), where I conduct research and teach on the interface between science, technology, and global security policy.

My security research focuses on the interactions between weapons technologies and policy. New technologies can reshape the nature of war, peace, and security. At the same time, sociopolitical forces shape the technologies we choose to develop and our expectations of their performance. My recent areas of focus include the [security implications of hypersonic missile technologies](https://camerontracy.github.io/files/Modeling_the_Performance_of_Hypersonic_Boost-Glide_Missiles.pdf), and the [technical challenges of nuclear disarmament](https://camerontracy.github.io/files/Mining_for_the_Bomb_The_Vulnerability_of_Buried_Plutonium_to_Clandestine_Recovery.pdf).

I also research the physics and chemistry of advanced materials. I use x-ray, neutron, and ion beam techniques to characterize the atomic-scale behavior of materials in extreme environments of temperature, pressure, and  irradiation. This work contributes to the development of [high-performance alloys](https://camerontracy.github.io/files/High_pressure_synthesis_of_a_hexagonal_close-packed_phase_of_the_high-entropy_alloy_CrMnFeCoNi.pdf), [safer nuclear fuels](https://camerontracy.github.io/files/Review_of_recent_experimental_results_on_the_behavior_of_actinide-bearing_oxides_and_related_materials_in_extreme_environments.pdf), and [techniques for tracking the smuggling of nuclear materials](https://camerontracy.github.io/files/Measurement_of_UO2_surface_oxidation_using_grazing-incidence_x-ray_diffraction_Implications_for_nuclear_forensics.pdf).

I teach undergraduate courses on research methods and scholarly writing, as well as a graduate course on the sociotechnical dynamics of weapons technology development. I also co-run CISAC’s [Undergraduate Honors Program in International Security Studies](https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/education/honors-program), guiding seniors from all majors as they conduct original research and write honors theses.

Policy-relevance is a major component of my scholarship. I have advised and briefed policymakers across a range of institutions, including the US Congress, the United Nations Disarmament and International Security Committee, and the UK Ministry of Defence. My research has been cited by organizations ranging from the [US Congressional Budget Office](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2023-01/58255-hypersonic.pdf) to the [Ukrainian Ministry of Defense](https://nti.ukrintei.ua/?page_id=5349&lang=en).
