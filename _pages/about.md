I am a Research Scholar at Stanford University’s [Center for International Security and Cooperation (CISAC)](https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/), where I conduct research and teach on the interface between science, technology, and global security policy.

My security research focuses on the interactions between weapons technologies and policy. The development or adoption of new technologies can dramatically reshape the nature of war, peace, and security, yet social and political forces also shape the technologies that nations choose to develop, and the manner in which they choose to use those technologies. I am particularly interested in the sociotechnical dynamics of systems that, due to their inherent technical complexity, demand the participation of scientists and engineers in security policy processes: nuclear, missile, and chemical weapons technologies, for instance. My recent areas of focus include the [security implications of hypersonic missile technologies](https://camerontracy.github.io/files/Modeling_the_Performance_of_Hypersonic_Boost-Glide_Missiles.pdf), and the [technical challenges of nuclear disarmament](https://camerontracy.github.io/files/Mining_for_the_Bomb_The_Vulnerability_of_Buried_Plutonium_to_Clandestine_Recovery.pdf).

I also research the physics and chemistry of advanced materials. I use x-ray, neutron, and ion beam techniques to characterize the atomic-scale behavior of materials in extreme environments of high temperature, high pressure, and intense irradiation. This work contributes to the development of [high-performance alloys](https://camerontracy.github.io/files/High_pressure_synthesis_of_a_hexagonal_close-packed_phase_of_the_high-entropy_alloy_CrMnFeCoNi.pdf), [safer nuclear fuels](https://camerontracy.github.io/files/Review_of_recent_experimental_results_on_the_behavior_of_actinide-bearing_oxides_and_related_materials_in_extreme_environments.pdf), and [techniques for tracking the smuggling of nuclear materials](https://camerontracy.github.io/files/Measurement_of_UO2_surface_oxidation_using_grazing-incidence_x-ray_diffraction_Implications_for_nuclear_forensics.pdf).

I teach undergraduate courses on research and writing in international security, as well as a graduate course on the sociotechnical dynamics of weapons technology development. I also co-run CISAC’s [Undergraduate Honors Program in International Security Studies](https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/education/honors-program), guiding seniors from all majors as they conduct original research and write honors theses.

Policy-relevance is a major component of my scholarship. I have advised and briefed policymakers across a range of institutions, including the US Congress, the United Nations Disarmament and International Security Committee, and the UK Ministry of Defence.

Prior to my current position, I have worked at Harvard University’s [Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs](https://www.belfercenter.org/), the [Union of Concerned Scientists](https://www.ucsusa.org/), and [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov/).
