I am a Research Scholar at the [Berkeley Risk and Security Lab](https://brsl.berkeley.edu/) in UC Berkeley's Goldman School of Public Policy, where I conduct research and teach on the interface between science, technology, and global security policy.

My research focuses on the development, governance, and implications of military technologies. New technologies can reshape the nature of war, peace, and security. At the same time, sociopolitical forces shape the weapons technologies that nations choose to develop and expectations of their performance. My recent work focuses on the [security implications of hypersonic missile technologies](https://camerontracy.github.io/files/Modeling_the_Performance_of_Hypersonic_Boost-Glide_Missiles.pdf), the [technical challenges of nuclear disarmament](https://camerontracy.github.io/files/Mining_for_the_Bomb_The_Vulnerability_of_Buried_Plutonium_to_Clandestine_Recovery.pdf), and the [roles of scientists and engineers in advising policymakers on technological risks](https://camerontracy.github.io/files/Weapons_Design_Engineering_Ethics_and_the_Duty_to_Inform_A_Case_Study_on_U.S._Hypersonic_Missile_Development.pdf).

I also conduct experimental research on the atomic-scale physics of complex materials in extreme environments of temperature, pressure, and irradiation. This work contributes to the development of [high-performance alloys](https://camerontracy.github.io/files/High_pressure_synthesis_of_a_hexagonal_close-packed_phase_of_the_high-entropy_alloy_CrMnFeCoNi.pdf), [safer nuclear fuels](https://camerontracy.github.io/files/Review_of_recent_experimental_results_on_the_behavior_of_actinide-bearing_oxides_and_related_materials_in_extreme_environments.pdf), and [techniques for tracking nuclear material smuggling](https://camerontracy.github.io/files/Measurement_of_UO2_surface_oxidation_using_grazing-incidence_x-ray_diffraction_Implications_for_nuclear_forensics.pdf).

I teach undergrad and graduate courses on research methods, scholarly writing, and the sociotechnical dynamics of weapons development. I previously co-led Stanford University's Undergrad Honors Program in International Security Studies.

Policy-relevance is a central component of my work. I have advised policymakers from a range of institutions, including the US Congress, the UK Ministry of Defence, and the UN Disarmament and International Security Committee. My research has been cited by organizations ranging from the [US Congressional Budget Office](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2023-01/58255-hypersonic.pdf) to the [Ukrainian Ministry of Defense](https://nti.ukrintei.ua/?page_id=5349&lang=en) and the [Japan Air Self-Defense Force](https://www.mod.go.jp/asdf/meguro/center/img/JASIreport20240606.pdf).
